Hello Famrman bahi, I am using python file to add HTMl code in the body of the email. I tried with many workflow formatts from the
github none of them worked with the HTML i was not able to add it in the email body.  so i found a way to do it through the python code.
then i learned how to make my .py file work with the yaml file. 
and now i have the HTML code of the site below as text.

Thank you,
Saad
